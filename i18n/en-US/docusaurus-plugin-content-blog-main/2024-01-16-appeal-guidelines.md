    <Imp>*DLC weapons</Imp> will not be shown in the gameplay report. Please refer to this article (google automatic translate should be enough): https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv23621444 and state in the email. <Imp>Be sure to find out all weapon farming gameplays so that your ban can be lifted ASAP.</Imp>
      
    <Imp>*AppealBot</Imp> is launched to deal with weapon farming email appeals. After receiving email appeals, the AppealBot will automatically change player status to “<Color color="darkseagreen">Farm weapons</Color>” if the following 2 requirements are satisfied: 1. Weapon abnormal stats back to normal after excluding the stat from farming report, 2. No DLC weapons in abnormal weapon list. The shortest time from sending an email to receiving the “<Color color="darkseagreen">Farm weapons</Color>” status is within 5 minutes. If a DLC weapon in the abnormal weapon list, manual confirmation from admin is required.

    For those players that the weapon stat is still abnormal after the stat calculation, please continue adding weapon farming gameplay URLs. If a player cannot find additional farming gameplays, please contact us (QQ group, or Discord), or you can send email and wait for manual confirmation from admin (manual confirmation will almost be the same as the calculation by robot.)

    **One-click weapon farming appeal** is now launched for testing, please contact community volunteers in the QQ group. It will automatically find the weapon farming gameplay URLs and format an email following the template, send it to the <Imp>AppealBot</Imp> and wait for it to process. The result can also be sent to a specified email address.

### 2. Self-proof Tutorial:

* **2.1**. In case you are banned by BFV ROBOT but no BFBAN case, please report yourself to BFBAN first.
* **2.2**. Arrange a self-proof requirement with the admin based on the in-game or lifetime stat in the reported case.
* **2.3**. Prepare software: MOSS (https://nohope.eu/) and screen recording software that you like (Nvidia, OBS, etc.)
* **2.4**. Start MOSS and screen recording software and record a gameplay that is equal to or over the arranged requirement. And send all the information within an email to ban-appeals@bfban.com. **All self-proof materials should be available 1 year after submission.**
* **2.5**. Please check whether the email is sent successfully. If it is bounced, please use another email service provider to send the email.
   
  *Recording requirements:

  * Clear first-perspective videos (resolution and frame rate should be equal or greater than 720p and 30fps), with MOSS activated during the self-proof gameplay to record computer processes and keyboard/mouse activities (DO NOT modify the MOSS files!!!).
  * The remaining gameplay time (ticket, time, points for capture in breakthrough) should be more than half at the time of joining, with the gameplay time longer than 10 minutes (if not specified by admin).
  * Self-proof process: 1. Start screen recording 2. Start MOSS (with BF1/BFV selected!!!) 3. Start game 4. Self-proof game play 4. Stop MOSS 5. Stop recording.
