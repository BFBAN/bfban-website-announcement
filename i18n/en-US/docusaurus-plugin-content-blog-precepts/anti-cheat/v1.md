> <u>BFBAN Anti-Cheat Ban Guidelines</u> is owned by BFBAN and used by BFBAN Admins (a.k.a.  the Admins). This guideline is to facilitate and standardized the judgements on the BFban.com website.
<!-- truncate -->

## Lifetime stats judge

* Judgment by BFBAN website robot (Menhera酱，Menhera-chan) serves as the benchmark case. Judgment from the BFV ROBOT can also be used as reference. (Most of the data threshold of the two robots are the same).
* Judgment should be comprehensive and based on actual gameplay, weapons, game understanding of the Admin and past cases.
* Lifetime stat of kills for a single weapon needs to reach 50 kills to serve as evidence. If multiple weapons all shows abnormal lifetime stats, they can be considered as evidence even with kills less than 50.
* For new BFV cases with evidence of abnormal weapon lifetime data only, the Admins should only follow up after it is being reported over 10 minutes and it has been identified by Menhera-chan.
* For new BFV cases with evidence of abnormal weapon lifetime data only, but not identified by Menhera-chan, the first Admin can either give suspicious (needs self-prove) status or **vote for confirmed cheater** based on his/her understanding of the game (2 votes are needed from Admins, or 1 vote from senior Admin).

## In-game stats judge

* Judgement should be based on abnormal data for actual gameplays.
* Abnormal data from a single match cannot be used as the only evidence for judgement **unless** the data from a single match is **extraordinarily** far away from normal gameplay (‘extraordinarily’ can be based on Admins’ personal understanding).
* The Admins should also recognize that gameplay is random and unpredictable, so that even normal players may have excellent single match data that way above their lifetime stat.
* Judgment scan be obtained from single match data and lifetime stat. Judgement cannot be obtained from **one** single match data unless there are multiple single match data that do not match the player’s lifetime stat.

## Video, and static picture judge

* Judgment based on the pictures provided by whistleblower.
  * The Admin should judge and verify whether the picture is related to the reported person and its authenticity.
  * The Admin should judge based on the picture and lifetime stat.
* Judgement based on the videos provided by whistleblower.
  * The Admin should judge and verify whether the video is related to the reported person and its authenticity.
  * The Admin should judge based on the video, actual gameplay scenario and understanding of the game.
  * The Admin should judge based on the video and lifetime stat.
  * If the video is from spectator, the Admin should judge based on the video, combined with the actual gameplay scenario, spectating nature, and considering factors such as spectating delays and spectating bugs comprehensively.

## Report based on chat history and e-commerce record.

* Report based on chat history must include at least 20 messages before and after (the key information cannot be deleted in the chat history, otherwise it will be considered as a false report.). Pictures, videos that contains defendant’s game id and hack-related information, or social media account that represent the defendant’s game id post any picture, videos that related to cheating, will be judged by the Admins. If social media account is hacked, detailed evidence must be showed for appeal. If it is difficult to prove the real social media account that is related to the game id, and the game id had been miss represented and post any cheat related information, the game id owner needs to MOSS self-prove his/her highest lifetime performance required by the Admins, and the account will be unlocked after 7 days if there’re no new issues arise.
* If the defendant is reported by tempering the chat records, pictures, videos, etc. and post them on social media/e-commerce platform. Appeals will only be accepted by the Admins after the defendant records the exact procedures of tempering in a video, and the reproduction in the video should be almost the same as the evidence. If a third party tampers the chat records, pictures, videos, etc. of the defendant, and posts them on social media/e-commerce platform that caused the defendant be reported, then the defendant should provide the original evidence to the Admins for appeal. (The effective date of this article is 2022.12.02. Confirmed Cheater that was confirmed before this date can appeal based on this article. This article is applicable to cases that have not been closed before this date. For case report time that is later than this date, but the incident happened earlier than this date, Admins should deal with them at their discretion.)

## About using vicious bugs and taking down servers.

* The BFBAN organization decided to ban players who intentionally use game bugs that are vicious, seriously affect the game balance, and destroy the game experience of others.
  * Players banned under this article can negotiate with the Admins:
    * First ban under this article can be lifted on the same day.
    * Second ban under this article can be lifted after one week.
    * Third ban under this article is permanent and will not be lifted.     
  * Exploding the server/taking down a server with any feature that is not permitted by EA/DICE is considered cheating and will be permanently banned.

## About using mouse macros

* Two types of mouse macros:
  * **Mouse auto-clicker macro**: use of third-party software to achieve automatic mouse or keyboard clicks.  
  * **Gun recoil suppress macro**: use of third-party software to automatically compensate gun recoil.
  
* **What to ban?**
* Auto-clicker can be used in many scenarios. The use of auto-clicker should be judged with actual gameplay situation and environment. For players who use the auto-clicker to automatically and continuously click on semi-automatic weapons, through self-expose, reported by others, record in MOSS and other evidence, will be banned.
* It is necessary to verify that the player has used the auto-clicker on the semi-automatic weapon before making a judgement. Use of gun recoil suppress macro will results in ban once it proved by evidence.

## About how to make judgements, and how to deal with disputes.

* Insufficient evidence should result in **Invalid report**.
* Insufficient evidence, but the player is highly **suspicious**. The first Admin that take the case, based on his/her judgement experience, can ask the player to perform MOSS self-prove within a time limit. The Admin also need to change the player status to Suspicious.
* The Admins can assign **voted for confirmed cheater** only when the evidence is clear and sufficient.
* When changing the status of a closed case, sufficient reasons must be justified.
* If there are doubts about the Admin or the case itself is controversial, the defendant may request more Admin to be involved. And the opinions of the majority Admins shall prevail.

## About appeal

* In case of reporting/self-proof evidence becomes invalid.
  * After a successful report, if the reporting evidence is deleted or lost within half a year, the report will become an **invalid report**. The Admin should change the defendant status to Invalid report until the reporter provides the evidence again.
  * After a successful self-proof, if the self-proof evidence is deleted or lost within one year, the appeal is deemed invalid. The Admin should change the defendant status to **Confirmed cheater** until the defendant provides the self-proof again.
  * If either evidence becomes invalid, the Admin should follow the above mentioned process. If both the reporting and self-proof evidence become invalid at the same time, the Admin should change the defendant status to Invalid report.
* Self-proof should follow the principle of “same case same account”, that is, the account that submitted self-proof must be consistent with the account in the case. If the account in the self-proof is not consistent with the account in the report, Admin should assign **Suspicious** to the case. (The effective date of this article is 2022.12.02. Confirmed cheater can appeal on their cases that was closed before this date. This article is applicable to cases that have not been closed before this date. Case reported after this date, but the time of incident is before this date, the Admin should deal with them at their discretion)

## Handling cases related to the use of unpacked weapons.

1. If there is clear evidence that the player actively used unpacked weapons on official DICE servers and community servers without passwords, the Admin should **vote for confirmed cheater**.
2. In  official DICE servers and community servers without passwords servers and due to unknown reasons, if players passively holds unpacked weapon or weapon that does not exist in the map, or there is no evidence shows that player actively used such weapon, the Admin should check the player’s battflefieldtracker record. If there’s kill record based on such weapon or extensive usage of unpacked equipment, the Admin should **vote for confirmed cheater**.
3. In official DICE servers and community servers without passwords, if there’s video evidence shows the player obviously interacted with a cheater for exchanging weapons , the Admin should vote for confirmed cheater and wait for the player to appeal.
4. In official DICE servers and community servers without passwords, if the player used a weapon that cannot be obtained from the map/server, the Admin should check and confirm whether the weapon used by the player can be obtained in such map/server. If not, the Admin should vote for confirmed cheater.
